# My custom fork of the [Configurable Map Viewer (CMV)](http://demo.cmv.io/viewer/)

Currently made up of cmv-app v1.3.1 with plugins developed by myself and others, with only minor modifications/customizations to the base code. I do my best to stick to AMD paradigm and I try to keep my code in harmony with the spirit of the CMV project.  However, I am facing new design requirements that will likely require me to fork this code into an entirely different animal or come up with a clever system for applying templates, or "skins", to the app.
